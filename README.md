### Setup Instructions
This project is meant to be used on a Windows operating system, but can be used across most common operating systems.

Python should be installed, which can be done here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Please ensure that Django is installed. You can install django by running `pip install django`

Then, you can populate your file system with the neccesary files to run the program by running `git clone https://github.com/EricX003/P1-396/` or downloading the submitted zip file, and unzipping it accordingly. 

Ensure that you are in the directory housing the P1-396 folder (do not enter the folder), if you are not, enter that directory.

Run `cd .\P1-396\P1_396\` (for Non-Windows systems, change the slashes accordingly).

You can then run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server, then click on the link to access the website.
